# Credit Analysis

Machine Learning Project with the famous "credit" dataset by using Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Generalised Linear Models (GLM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with R conducted by Matthias De Paolis, Lukas Niederh√§user and Daniel Podolecki.

## SUMMARY
In the zip-folder you will find the PDF-File and the corresponding R-Markdown with the Analysis of Credit Data in Germany from 1994 by using various Machine Learning Methods. The Analysis is done using the Programming Language R.

Furthermore the zip-folder contains the credit data required for the analysis. This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.

## USAGE
To run the analysis it is recommended to extract the zip-folder and store all the data in a place of your choice. In R or R-Studio you need to refer to the csv named "dataset_31_credit-g.csv". Therefore setwd () to your folder where you extracted the data in the zip file.
